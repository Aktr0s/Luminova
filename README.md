### A program written in Java that sorts pixels in an image creating a nice effect and also making GIF (animated) like glitch effects

### The idea for the whole program was from here: [Pixel-Sorting by Acerola](https://github.com/GarrettGunnell/Pixel-Sorting)

### The building is buggy cause im stooopid and can't figure out Maven, thats why i was building using IntelliJ IDEA 
But yeah Maven building works with this command

```
$ mvn clean package
```

### Also Luminova is written in JavaFX which is my first time using so while the sorting algo is written by ChatGPT

### BUT the GUI and all the handliung was written by me (Spaghetti)
