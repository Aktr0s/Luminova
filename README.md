### A program written in Java that sorts pixels in an image creating a nice effect and also capable of making animated glitch effects that export to GIF
> [!NOTE]
> ### The whole inspiration: [Pixel-Sorting by Acerola](https://github.com/GarrettGunnell/Pixel-Sorting)

### The building is buggy cause im stooopid and can't figure out Maven, that's why i was building using IntelliJ IDEA

But yeah Maven building works with this command

```
$ mvn clean package
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Requires JDK 17 — _WILL NOT_ run with Java 8 or older JREs**
>
> Make sure you're running the .jar with JDK 17, _especially_ on Windows.

### Sorting algorythim is written by ChatGPT (Since for me it was a pain to comprehend)

### But GUI is all done by me — first time using JavaFX, so yeah... spaghetti code galore 🍝
